            “Haiku are meant to evoke an emotional response from the reader, 
            to light the spark that triggers creative rumination. 
            They act as literary manifestations. 
            visions of nature’s seasonal modulations. 
            They're emotionally tinged words, 
            barely perceptible sensory flickers, 
            literary etchings of lucid visions transposed 
            into the minds of its readers. 
            They're meant to act as sensory catalysts, 
            like the passing of a penciled baton 
            laid out upon a piece of paper that a reader might g
            rasp for in their mind's eye, all of which prompts the 
            reader to continue exploring the sensory experience 
            elicited from the writers pen. 
            This is how the literary sketching of poets are 
            intended to function. 
            as creative muses with which readers can draw 
            from and viscerally apply to their own artistic idioms, 
            from that lucid space within their heads. 
            where their minds eye can spark their own creative visions" <br />

                MicroPoetry is a place my favorite words, quotes, story, and poem. 
                I don't have the ability or creativity to structure my own words to make a poem or quote. 
                But, i really love to collect poems and quote. Everytime i found a beautiful
                words, i have to save it. <br />
                At first, i created this blog just to share haiku. But, in the end, i decided to post another 
                literary pieces that i also found beautiful.
                So, i created this blog to share some of my favorite literary pieces that i found on many sources. 
                Of course, i'll also give the source to give credit to the creator.
                <br />
